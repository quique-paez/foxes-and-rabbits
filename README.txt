# Project Description

## Foxes and Rabbits Simulation

This repository houses the code for a simulation project called Foxes and Rabbits. Inspired by the concepts from the book *'An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java'* by David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling, this project aims to expand upon the simulation described in the book.

### Background

The simulation is based on the classic predator-prey model, where foxes hunt rabbits within a shared environment. The original implementation presented in the book serves as the foundation for this project. Our goal is to build upon this foundation by adding new features, enhancing performance, and providing a more interactive and customizable experience.

### Goals

- **Expansion:** Introduce new elements such as additional predator or prey species, environmental factors, or behavioral dynamics.
- **Optimization:** Improve the efficiency and scalability of the simulation algorithm to handle larger populations or more complex scenarios.
- **Customization:** Provide users with options to configure simulation parameters, visualize data, or interact with the simulation in real-time.
- **Documentation:** Ensure clear and comprehensive documentation to facilitate understanding, usage, and contribution from the community.
